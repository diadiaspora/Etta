YES. Speed + quality is *the* combo recruiters and design leads notice immediately.
Keyboard shortcuts matter—but the **real speed gains come from systems, habits, and file strategy**. I’ll break this into:

1. **How designers actually work fast in Figma (beyond shortcuts)**
2. **High-leverage habits that compound speed**
3. **The most important Figma keyboard shortcuts (the ones pros actually use daily)**

## 1. How UX/UI Designers Work Fast (Beyond Keyboard Shortcuts)

### 🔹 Design in Systems, Not Screens

Fast designers almost never “start from scratch.”

Do this instead:

* Build components **before** designing full screens
* Duplicate and modify instead of recreating
* Design **1 canonical screen**, then reuse it

💡 Rule of thumb:
If you’ve designed something twice, it should be a component.

---

### 🔹 Start with Gray (Seriously)

Color slows you down early.

Workflow:

1. Wireframe in grayscale
2. Lock layout & hierarchy
3. Apply styles at the end

This avoids endless tweaking and rework.

---

### 🔹 Auto Layout = Speed Multiplier

Once you’re fluent, Auto Layout:

* Eliminates resizing manually
* Lets content adapt instantly
* Makes iteration *much* faster

Slow designers fight Auto Layout.
Fast designers *trust* it.

---

### 🔹 Use “Detach Only When Necessary”

New designers detach too much.

Instead:

* Stay in components as long as possible
* Use overrides (text, visibility, swap)
* Detach only when structure must change

This keeps updates fast and global.

---

### 🔹 Duplicate With Intent

Instead of redesigning:

* Duplicate a screen
* Change only what’s needed
* Compare versions side by side

This mirrors real product iteration.

---

### 🔹 Work in Sections & Pages

Sections = mental clarity = speed.

Use:

* Sections for flows
* Pages for phases (Research / Wireframes / Design / Prototype)

You waste less time searching.

---

### 🔹 Templates Are Not Cheating

Professional designers rely on:

* Personal starter files
* Component libraries
* Saved design systems

Speed comes from **reuse**, not genius.

## 2. High-Leverage Habits That Make You Fast

### ⚡ Name Things Immediately

Unnamed layers slow everything down later.

Good:

* `Button / Primary / Default`
  Bad:
* `Rectangle 23`

---

### ⚡ Use the Command Palette Constantly

This is an underrated speed weapon.

Shortcut:
`Cmd / Ctrl + /`

Use it to:

* Create components
* Swap tools
* Find hidden features

---

### ⚡ Zoom Discipline

* `Z` to zoom
* `Cmd/Ctrl + 1` to zoom to 100%
* `Shift + 1` to zoom to selection

You should almost never pinch/scroll aimlessly.

---

### ⚡ Think in “Flows,” Not Artboards

Fast designers ask:

> “What’s the next screen?”

Not:

> “How do I polish this forever?”

### 🧠 Pro Speed Tricks (Small but Powerful)

* Hold `Alt/Option` → see spacing & size
* Hold `Shift` → resize proportionally
* Arrow keys → nudge
* `Shift + Arrow` → nudge by 10px
* Drag while holding `Cmd/Ctrl` → duplicate

## What Recruiters *Really* Notice About Speed

They won’t ask:

> “How fast are you in Figma?”

They *will* notice:

* You don’t hesitate
* You don’t hunt through menus
* Your files are clean
* You iterate confidently

Speed reads as **experience**.
