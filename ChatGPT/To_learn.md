Love this approach. Using one project to *really* master Figma is exactly how recruiters can tell the difference between “knows the tool” and “is a designer.”

I’ll break this into **(1) must-have Figma skills**, **(2) advanced skills that make you stand out**, and **(3) what recruiters are actually scanning for when they open your file or portfolio**.

---

## 1. Non-Negotiable Figma Skills (Baseline for UX/UI Roles)

If you don’t have these, recruiters assume you’re junior or self-taught *without* real workflow experience.

### 🔹 Auto Layout (this is huge)

Recruiters *absolutely* expect this.

You should be able to:

* Build components **entirely with Auto Layout**
* Use:

  * Padding vs spacing correctly
  * Nested Auto Layouts
  * Fill container vs Hug contents
* Update text length without breaking layouts
* Make responsive cards, nav bars, forms

💡 *Signal to recruiters:*
“I understand scalable, real-world UI—not static mockups.”

---

### 🔹 Components & Variants

This is one of the first things design managers check.

You should confidently use:

* Components vs instances
* Variants for:

  * Button states (default / hover / disabled)
  * Input states (empty / filled / error)
  * Size variants (small / medium / large)
* Component properties:

  * Boolean
  * Instance swap
  * Text properties

💡 *Signal:*
“I design systems, not one-off screens.”

---

### 🔹 Design Systems (Even a Small One)

You **don’t** need a massive system—but you do need *structure*.

Must include:

* Color styles (semantic names, not “blue 1”)
* Text styles (H1, body, caption, etc.)
* Spacing consistency
* Reusable components

Bonus:

* Light documentation page inside Figma
* Notes explaining usage

💡 *Signal:*
“I can collaborate with devs and scale a product.”

---

### 🔹 Constraints & Responsive Behavior

Recruiters care more about *how things behave* than how pretty they are.

You should know:

* Left / right / center constraints
* Scale vs fixed behavior
* How screens adapt to different widths
* Basic breakpoint thinking (desktop → tablet → mobile)

💡 *Signal:*
“I think beyond one screen size.”

---

### 🔹 Clean File Organization

This matters more than people admit.

Your file should show:

* Named frames (not “Frame 43”)
* Logical pages:

  * Research
  * Wireframes
  * Design
  * Components
  * Prototypes
* Consistent naming conventions

💡 *Signal:*
“I won’t slow down a team.”

---

## 2. High-Impact Skills That Make You Stand Out

These are what turn interviews into offers.

### ✨ Prototyping (but purposeful)

Recruiters don’t want flashy animations for no reason.

Focus on:

* User flows (happy path + edge cases)
* Overlays (modals, dropdowns, tooltips)
* Smart Animate *only when it adds clarity*
* Micro-interactions (button press, loading)

💡 *Signal:*
“I design experiences, not just interfaces.”

---

### ✨ Variables & Modes (Advanced but 🔥)

This is newer, and **very impressive** if used well.

Learn:

* Color variables
* Light/Dark mode
* Component state variables

You don’t need everything—but showing awareness is powerful.

💡 *Signal:*
“I’m up-to-date with modern workflows.”

---

### ✨ UX Thinking Visible *Inside* Figma

Recruiters LOVE when reasoning is visible.

Examples:

* Annotations explaining decisions
* Flow diagrams
* Edge-case screens
* Empty states & error states

💡 *Signal:*
“I think like a UX designer, not a decorator.”

---

### ✨ Collaboration Features

Especially important for mid-level roles.

Know how to:

* Use comments effectively
* Share links with permissions
* Prepare files for handoff
* Use Inspect panel considerations for devs

💡 *Signal:*
“I’ve worked cross-functionally.”

---

## 3. What Recruiters Actually Look For (The Unspoken Checklist)

When a recruiter or hiring manager opens your Figma or portfolio, they’re subconsciously asking:

### ❌ “Is this just Dribbble UI?”

or

### ✅ “Could this ship in a real product?”

They look for:

### ✔ Consistency

* Same spacing rules
* Same button behavior everywhere
* Same typography logic

### ✔ Decision-making

* Why this layout?
* Why this interaction?
* Why this flow?

### ✔ Scalability

* Could this handle 20 more features?
* Could another designer pick this up?

### ✔ Realistic UX

* Error states
* Loading states
* Empty states
* Accessibility awareness (contrast, font size)

## How to Use *This* Project to Maximize Impact

Since you said this project is your **Figma mastery vehicle**, here’s the move:

### Build it like a real product team would:

1. Start with **low-fi wireframes**
2. Move to **mid-fi with Auto Layout**
3. Create **components early**
4. Introduce a **mini design system**
5. Prototype a **core user flow**
6. Add **annotations + rationale**
7. Polish organization & naming

One *excellent* Figma file > five pretty but shallow projects.

If you want, next we can:

* Turn this into a **Figma skill checklist** you can track
* Review a **Figma file structure template**
* Decide what level (junior / mid / senior) this project should target
* Translate these skills directly into **resume bullet points**

Just tell me where you want to go next 👀
