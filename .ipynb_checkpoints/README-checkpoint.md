# 🌿 Etta — Words, Roots, Cultures

**Etta** is an exploratory language-learning and etymology app that helps users understand how words evolve across Romance languages by tracing them back to their Latin roots.

Etta treats words as cultural artifacts — blending linguistics, history, and cross-cultural meaning into a single, comparative learning experience.

---

## ✨ Concept

Instead of teaching languages in isolation, Etta allows learners to explore **Spanish, French, Italian, and Portuguese together**, side-by-side, through their shared Latin ancestry.

Users start with an **English word** and discover:

* Its **Latin root**
* How that root evolved in each Romance language
* Shifts in meaning, spelling, and usage
* Cultural or historical context behind each word

The goal is **depth, not fluency drills** — a peak, reflective learning experience rather than gamified repetition.

---

## 🧠 Learning Philosophy

Etta is grounded in how people *actually* learn languages:

* **Comparative learning** improves pattern recognition
* **Etymology strengthens long-term retention**
* **Narrative + cultural context** increases emotional engagement
* **Cognitive mapping** helps learners transfer knowledge between languages

This approach supports:

* Polyglots & language enthusiasts
* UX designers & writers interested in language
* Curious learners who enjoy meaning over memorization

---

## 🎯 Target User

**Primary audience (Peak Experience Users):**

* Curious, reflective learners
* Language lovers (A2–C1 level, not beginners)
* Designers, writers, academics, and creatives
* People who enjoy slow learning, reading, and discovery

This is not a Duolingo replacement — it’s a **language museum + atlas**.

---

## 🧩 Core Features

* Curated word exploration (not unlimited free search)
* Autocomplete / guided search to prevent dead ends
* Side-by-side Romance language comparison
* Latin root breakdown

## 🧱 Tech Stack (Proposed)

### Frontend

* **React**
* Component-based UI for comparison views
* Ideal for UX experimentation & interaction design

### Backend

* **Python (FastAPI or Flask)** *or* **Node.js**
* Handles:

  * Word lookup
  * Autocomplete logic
  * API requests
  * Future scalability

### Data Layer

* Curated **JSON / database** of words
* Limited vocabulary by design (quality over quantity)
* Prevents “word not found” errors
* Enables editorial control and storytelling

---

## 🔍 Why Not Free Search?

Etta is intentionally **curated**.

Instead of allowing any arbitrary input:

* Users are guided through autocomplete
* All searchable words exist in the database
* This preserves narrative quality and UX integrity

This is a **design choice**, not a limitation.

---

## 💼 Portfolio Value

Etta demonstrates:

* Product thinking
* UX research & learning theory
* Information architecture
* Interaction design
* Frontend + backend reasoning
* Editorial and cultural sensitivity

This project fits beautifully in:

* UX / Product Design portfolios
* Full-stack portfolios
* HCI-focused case studies

---

## 🚧 Project Status

Concept, UX design, and initial technical planning.

Future iterations may include:

* Timelines
* Audio pronunciation
* User-created word collections
* Essays or “word stories”
