 **Phase 1 — Planning & Research (1 week)**

* Define **goal statement, user group, and design principles**
* Curate **initial vocabulary** (20–50 words for v1)
* Sketch **site map and user flows**
* Decide **data model / structure** (JSON schema or simplified mock data)

**Deliverable:**

  * Saved Words / Personal Collection
* Focus on **information hierarchy and user journey**
* Optional: rough layout of optional “Surprise Me” or related words

**Deliverable:**

* Low-fidelity wireframes (paper or Figma)

---

 **Phase 3 — High-Fidelity Design (2 weeks)**

* Translate wireframes into **high-fidelity mockups** in Figma:

  * Typography, color palette, UI components
  * Autocomplete / guided search behavior
  * Tabs or sections in Word Overview
  * Buttons, navigation, micro-interactions
* Design **empty states / curated feedback screens** for missing words
